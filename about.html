        <h3>About Me</h3>
        <p>
            Hello, I’m Nassira — a freelance Business Intelligence and Data Analyst with a background in Economics and Business Administration, and a passion for helping small retail and e-commerce businesses grow using the power of data.<br><br>

Over the past few years, I’ve built a strong foundation in data analytics through hands-on projects, and specialized training in tools like Excel, Power BI, Tableau, SQL, R, and Python. But what sets me apart isn’t just the technical skills — it’s my deep understanding of how businesses work, especially in the fast-moving world of e-commerce. <br><br>

I know that as a small business owner or manager, your time is limited and your data is often scattered — across spreadsheets, online stores, marketing platforms, or CRMs. My role is to help you make sense of that data and use it to make smart, strategic decisions that actually move your business forward.<br> <br>

Whether it’s:<br>
<ul>
    <li>Cleaning and organizing messy sales or customer data</li>
    <li>Building dashboards to track KPIs like revenue, orders, customer value, or conversion rates</li>
    <li>Analyzing product performance to see what’s driving profit (and what’s not)</li>
    <li>Segmenting customers based on behavior to improve targeting and retention</li>
    <li>Creating simple, structured databases to store and manage your business data more effectively</li>
    <li>Or automating recurring reports so you can save time and focus on growth —</li>
</ul>
<br>

I’m here to deliver practical solutions tailored to your goals.<br><br>

For businesses ready to go a step further, I also create predictive models using machine learning techniques to forecast sales trends, anticipate customer behavior, or assess marketing performance. This means you don’t just understand what happened — you can start planning ahead, based on your own data.<br><br>

My approach is collaborative and business-minded. I ask the right questions, dive deep into your data, and translate numbers into clear, visual insights you can act on — even if you’re not “a data person.” <br><br>

I truly believe that data doesn’t have to be overwhelming. With the right tools and strategy, it becomes your greatest asset — helping you stay focused, spot opportunities, and grow with confidence. <br><br>

If you're ready to make your data work for you, not against you — let’s connect.
