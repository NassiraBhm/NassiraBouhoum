									<h3> <a href="https://github.com/NassiraBhm/LoanApprovalAnalysis">  Loan approval analysis </a></h3>
									<p>In this project, the objective was to analyze the factors influencing loan approval and to develop predictive models to better understand this process. The project began with an exploratory data analysis (EDA), where different categories of variables were studied, including demographic factors, loan characteristics, and variables related to creditworthiness. This step allowed us to identify initial trends and insights, such as the potential relationships between certain variables and loan approval. Then conducted statistical tests to confirm whether the differences observed between groups were statistically significant. In the second phase, machine learning models were developed to predict loan approval. Finally, the project concluded with the creation of an interactive dashboard in Tableau that summarizes the exploratory data analysis. </p>
